#   08-Build_presence_absence_table.py
#
#   This function creates two types of tables: a presence-absence table
#   and a Shrunken Log2FC table. The presence-absence table represents
#   whether a miRNA is present (1) or absent (0) in a specific stress
#   event. In contrast, the Shrunken Log2FC table includes the Shrunken
#   Log2FC values of those miRNAs that are represented in the respective
#   stress event. In both tables the events are placed in the columns
#   using identifiers created by the program, where the species, the
#   stress and the event in question are considered. Meanwhile, the
#   rows show the miRNA families annotated in all the experiments
#   considered. This table indicates that at least one member of the
#   miRNA family has been differentially expressed in a given stress
#   event, represented by a 1 (or its Shrunken log2FC), while the
#   absence of these miRNAs is indicated by a 0 (or NA). This program
#   also generates a table in which the identifiers created from the
#   program are related to the stress events they are linked to, among
#   other things.

## FUNCTIONS

def GetEventsIds(path_in: str, path_out: str):
    '''
    This function creates an identifier for each stress event. These
    identifiers consist of 3 numbers separated by ".". The first one refers to
    the species, the second one to the type of stress and the third one to the
    stress event. Finally, this function returns a dictionary whose key is the
    name of the file associated to that stress event (e.g. PRJNA277424_1_2)
    and as value a list containing the new generated identifier, the species,
    the stress and the stress event itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path_in : str
        Absolute path of the differential expression analysis summary file,
        which relates the file name to the stress event. 
    path_out : str
        Absolute path of the output file of the table with the new identifiers,
        files name, species, stresses and stress events.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Dictionary with the new identifiers, the files name, species, stresses
        and stress events.

def GetMiRNAFamilies(path_in_annot: str, dic_id_event: dict):
    '''
    This function receives as parameters the absolute path of the differentially
    expressed miRNAs annotation directory and a dictionary in which the name of
    the file associated with a given stress event (e.g. PRJNA277424_1_2) is
    related to its new identifier (1.4.7), the species, the stress and the
    stress event itself. From these two variables, this function creates a 
    dictionary with the miRNA families (values) that are differentially
    expressed in each stress event (key) and a list of tuples with the miRNA
    family represented in that stress event and its corresponding Shrunken
    log2FoldChange value (selected from the most representative member of the
    family). This information is useful when the desired table includes
    log2fc values instead of presence-absence data.

    Parameters
    ----------

        Absolute path of the differentially expressed miRNAs annotation directory.
    dic_id_event : dict

    -------
    dict
        Dictionary whose keys are the identifiers of the stress events in
        question, and the value associated with each of these keys is a list of 
        tuples. These tuples contain, in the first element, one of the miRNAs
